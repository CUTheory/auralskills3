# Summary of course policies #

Be professional.

I do not grade attendance directly. Nor do I grade assignment completion, give points for "effort," accept late work, or give extra credit. In *rare* cases, exceptions can be made for students who are diligent in their work, petition for an exception *in writing* as soon as they realize that an exception may be needed, and make a legitimate case that an exception is warranted. 

All CU policies, including the Honor Code, cover this course.
