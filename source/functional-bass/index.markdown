Wednesday's class was a little rough, as some of you took issue with the introduction of functional bass. I've reflected on this a fair bit myself, talked to a few of you, and talked to Carter (who has talked to a few of you also). It seems like the discomfort that occurred for some of you was not simply due to the introduction of something new, but due to a combination of different circumstances: not only was there new material, but it came the week before break, a number of you had not done the preperatory work assigned, and those of you in Carter's theory class had not covered all of the chromatic chords yet. Given how simple functional bass is, and how little of it is actually *new* (you all already know T/S/D, bass scale degrees, figured bass, prolongation, etc.), I am certain that had all of the above factors not met each other in a single class meeting, this would not have been such a big deal. 

You all also performed very well on our first attempt at bass and melody sing-backs: just about everyone sang back the bass or melody perfectly on one hearing for a five-chord progression. (The dictations we'll be focusing on in the final assessment are about twice as long, so dictating outer voices in four hearings or so should be a piece of cake for most of you.) Part of this is because the complexity of each outer voice is less than that of the melodies we've been dealing with in our transcription and dictation the past few weeks, and because I have *intentionally* been including melodic patterns in our singbacks that include the standard patterns that pop up in these sorts of bass lines.

All that is to say that while it seems to some of you like we're beginning a new and complicated unit very close to the end of the semester, we are not. Functional bass is the *only* truly new addition to class at this point, and it is a bringing together of things you are already familiar with in a way that I believe will make the harmonic listening tasks easier once you set about to learning it. (And if not, you will have other experiences on which to draw, as well.)

It is also apparent that *assessment* is driving a fair portion of the anxiety here. If this were simply a matter of an expert providing you a new approach to something you are learning that may be helpful for you, it wouldn't be much of an issue. However, the thought of final assessments coming up soon looms large in many of your mindsâ€”and understandably so. However, my primary job is to teach you and help you grow in your musicianship, only secondarily to assess whether you have mastered the material by the arbitrary (and often pedagogically unhelpful) deadlines at the ends of semesters. Likewise, your job is first to grow in your musicianship and only secondarily (and as much after-the-fact as possible) to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material in a complete way. 

Of course, I understand the reality of grades, GPA, scholarships, etc. However, I am confident that those of you *who have been putting a reasonable effort* into your theory and aural skills work throughout the semester will have absolutely no problem mastering the harmonic listening tasks I'll put before you in these final weeks. And if not, please know that *when final grades are determined, I will not hold anyone responsible for something that the class has not been adequately prepared for*. If it becomes clear in the final class meetings that even the students who are putting full effort into the class are having significant trouble with something, I will cut it from the list of final assessments and we will revisit it in the spring. (Keep in mind that students in the other sections have the same aural skills curriculum and the same theory instructors, and will likely be having the same issues.)

I hope that alleviates some of your concerns about grades and assessment. And I hope that our work together after fall break will alleviate your concerns about the content, to the extent that you are concerned. However, this issue has brought up a couple other concerns that I think are important to address. Because of that, I've written a [second post]({{ root_url }}/functional-bass/general.html) laying out some important things for you all to think about as we move forward. Please read it before returning to break, and do not hesitate to email me, or schedule a video chat, during break if you want to talk about these things, or to schedule an appointment during my office hours when we return. My goal is the same as yours: to help you become the best musicians and the most well-rounded, educated people as possible. Let's work together as best we can to pursue that goal.
