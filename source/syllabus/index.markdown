# Musical concepts and fluency #

The goal of this course is *musical fluency*: that is, the successful depositing of musical information into readily-accessible long-term memory, and the successful cognitive assimilation of musical concepts and structures. 

We will seek fluency in the following conceptual areas and skills (which will serve as assessment criteria):

- Standard rhythms in simple and compound meters (to the subdivision level; Kazez, Unit I)
- Irregular division of the beat in simple and compound meters (Kazez, Unit II)  
- Diatonicism in tonal melodies  
- Chromaticism in tonal melodies (centered around the German Lied)  
- Modulation to closely related keys in tonal melodies  
- Functional diatonicism in tonal harmonic progressions
- Functional chromaticism in tonal harmonic progressions  
- Performance  
- Transcription  
- Dictation  
- Professionalism

That fluency will be practiced and/or assessed through the following tasks:

- Performance with practice  
- Performance from sight  
- Error detection  
- Aural identification of basic structures from a recording  
- Self-paced transcription  
- Live, instructor-paced dictation

# Units of study #

The concepts and tasks listed above overlap significantly, so any unit boundaries will necessarily be fluid. In general, though, the course will progress from *performance* to *transcription* to *listening/aural analysis* for each concept, with rhythm coming first, then melody, then harmonic progressions. Class activities will progress according to the following *rough* outline.

- Unit I: Performance of rhythm  
- Unit II: Transcription of rhythm; performance of melody  
- Unit III: Dictation of rhythm; transcription of melody and bass lines; performance of harmonic progressions  
- Unit IV: Dictation of melody and bass lines; transcription of harmonic progressions  
- Unit V: Dictation/aural analysis of harmonic progressions

See courswork document for information on end-of-unit assessments.
