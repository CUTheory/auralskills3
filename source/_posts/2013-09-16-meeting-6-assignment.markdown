*Before Meeting 7 (Sept. 18/19), please do the following:*

- Finish updating your self-evaluation for the end of Unit I, if necessary.  
- Read the resource on [chromatic solfège](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/chromaticSolfege.html) and come prepared to sing the sequentials in that resource in class.  
- Bring a printed or digital copy of [*Die schöne Müllerin*](http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/03233) to class.  
- Find at least three examples (total, *not* three of each kind!) of the rhythmic features listed in the Unit II guide. List them in Piazza under the appropriate post. *Do not repeat examples provided by others in the class, including those in other sections.* This will be one large collection generated by all five sections of the course working together.
