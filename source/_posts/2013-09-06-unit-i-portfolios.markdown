Meeting 5 (Sept. 11/12) is the end of Unit I. Be sure to sign up for a rhythmic sight-singing exam slot for that day with your instructor.

Video portfolios must be completed, revised (if necessary), and shared with your instructor on Google Drive by 8am the morning of your Meeting 5 class day. Since this is the fourth round of video submissions, there has been plenty of time to work out any technological kinks, and therefore, there will be no late submissions accepted. Make sure that all seven exercises are included, and that they are as close to flawless as possible.

Please review the section on "summative assessments" on the [Coursework]({{ root_url }}/coursework) page before submitting your portfolios and coming to your sight-singing exams.
