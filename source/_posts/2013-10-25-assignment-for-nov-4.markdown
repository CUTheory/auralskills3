Before your November 4/5 class meeting, begin work on your keyboard performance portfolio. Record a video of yourself performing the first three (or more, if comfortable) exercises. Try to make them perfect, so that you do not need to revise them later. Choose any reasonable tempo that is comfortable. You may also sumbit audio recordings made in the keyboard lab that authenticate via your IdentiKey, if you already know how to do that.
