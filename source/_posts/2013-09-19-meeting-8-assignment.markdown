For 8am the day after Meeting 8 (Tuesday/Wednesday, Sept. 24/25), make a video of your performance of p. 1 of "Der Neugierige" (movement VI of *Die schöne Müllerin*: [recording](https://play.spotify.com/user/kris.shaffer/playlist/1SaXv4tlZlW931nZ9a8q1o), [score](http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/03233)) upload to Google Drive, and share with your instructor.

For Meeting 9 (Wednesday/Thursday, Sept. 25/26), listen to "Der Neugierige", and for every harmonic cadence, note the key and cadence type (PAC/IAC/HC) on the score and bring to class.

Also, practice the harmonic sequentials and arpeggio exercises distributed in class.
