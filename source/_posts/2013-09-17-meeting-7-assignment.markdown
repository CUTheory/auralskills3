*By 8am the day after meeting 7 (Sept. 26), SHAFFER's section only:*

Log in to [Learning Catalytics](http://learningcatalytics.com) (purchase a semester license if you have not already), and enter session ID 56392 to take a quiz on "Die böse Farbe" from *Die schöne Müllerin*. Have your score handy, and answer the questions about keys in the song. You may also use a recording (such as Ian Bostridge, [available on Spotify](spotify:user:kris.shaffer:playlist:1SaXv4tlZlW931nZ9a8q1o)) or a keyboard.

*Before meeting 8 (Sept. 30/Oct. 1), ALL STUDENTS:*

- Respond to at least 6 examples listed by your classmates in the collaborative playlists on Piazza. If their example is correct, say so. If not, offer a respectful correction, adding the example to another playlist if necessary.  
- Begin practicing your first prepared song ("Die Neugerige", from *Die schöne Müllerin*). A video atempt will be due the day after Meeting 8 (Oct. 1/2), so make use of the weekend to prepare well.

Be sure to bring your copy of *Die schöne Müllerin* to class, as well as any other materials your instructor has required (none for Shaffer).
