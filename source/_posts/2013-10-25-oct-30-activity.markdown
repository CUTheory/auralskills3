I will be at a conference on Wednesday. In lieu of a class meeting, get together with your transcription group during class time at a location of your choosing (a practice room, perhaps) and work on your transcription project. At the end of the 50 minutes, compose a short paragraph detailing the progress made on the project during that time, and make sure that your updated version is uploaded to Google Drive as a PDF. I prefer if you upload new PDF files each time you update your transcription (named version 1, version 2, etc.) so that I can track your progress.
