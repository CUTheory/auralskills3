For *the day after meeting 12 (Tues./Wed., Oct. 8/9)*, do the following:

- Respond to at least six of your classmates' rhythm excerpts on Piazza, as before. Affirm or critique (gently and helpfully).  
- Make a video of yourself singing "Der Müller und der Bach" as accurately as possible, noting modulations in your syllables, and submit it to your instructor via Google Drive.

This will take quite some time, so be sure not to wait until Monday/Tuesday evening to begin. And do use a recording, a keyboard, or a classmate as you learn "Der Müller und der Bach," so that you can get those modulations and chromatic-chord arpeggios into your ear.
