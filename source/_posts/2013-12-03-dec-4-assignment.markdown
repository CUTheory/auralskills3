For **8am, Friday, Dec. 6,** update your self-evaluation. On your self-assessment document, please re-write each section from scratch (copying and pasting is fine, though, if it fits the guidelines below). Don't worry about losing any material. Everything you erase from a Google Doc is still accessible in the document history. Your new self-assessment should contain all of the same categories. For each category, write no more than a single paragraph that touches on all of the points listed below, and assign yourself a letter grade for every category except for dictation. Please follow the rubric below *precisely*.

For **class on Monday, Dec. 9,** practice your melodic sight-singing with the melodies distributed in class on Wednesday. The final dictation melodies will be drawn from the missing pages in those chapters. They will be easier excerpts of the same variety, so the more you practice with these, the better prepared you will be for the final. You may also find the [Sight-singing tips](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/sightSinging.html) on the resources site helpful as you prepare for the exam.
