Unit II materials are due before class on Monday/Tuesday, Oct. 14/15. Your Unit II portfolio should include the following:

- a video of a (nearly) flawless performance of "Der Neugierige" uploaded to Google Drive; clearly lableled with your last name, the song title, and "FINAL" in the file name; and shared with your instructor.  
- a video of a (nearly) flawless performance of "Der MÃ¼ller und der Bach" uploaded to Google Drive; clearly lableled with your last name, the song title, and "FINAL" in the file name; and shared with your instructor.  
- one example of each of the six rhythmic categories on the Unit II Guide, posted on Piazza under the appropriate heading, and vetted by your classmates.  
- An updated self-evaluation containing grades and comments for *standard rhythms*, *irregular division of the beat*, *diatonicism in tonal melodies*, *chromaticism in tonal melodies*, *modulation to closely related keys*, *performance*, *transcription (aural recognition)*, and *professionalism*. Your grades and comments should reference all relevant work this semester, not only Unit II.

If you have any questions or difficulties, contact your instructor well ahead of the deadline.
