Before your Nov. 6/7 class meeting, complete your keyboard video/recording portfolio (adding the last three excerpts to the three created for Nov. 4/5). After you receive feedback from your instructor, you will have one more opportunity to fix and re-submit some/all of those videos, but do your best to make them (nearly) perfect so that you need not redo them later.
