FOR SHAFFER SECTION ONLY:

In addition to [the assignment already posted](http://cutheory.github.io/auralskills3/2013/10/meeting-11-and-12-assignment/) for Tuesday morning, also take the [Learning Catalytics](http://learningcatalytics.com) quiz on the cadences in "Erlk√∂nig" (session ID 731080) before Wednesday's class. Some of these were already covered in class. You can find the video played in class [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3nxyS8wf8E). Audio recordings abound. The score passed out in class can be downloaded [here](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/IMSLP15041-SchubertD328_Erlk__nig_4th_version.pdf).
