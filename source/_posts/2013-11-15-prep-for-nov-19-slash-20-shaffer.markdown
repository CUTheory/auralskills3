For **Tuesday, Nov. 19, 8am**, please do the following:

- Read the [Harmonic functions](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/harmonicFunctions.html) resource.  
- Read the [Harmonic syntax](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/harmonicSyntax.html) resource.  
- Log in to [Learning Catalytics](http://learningcatalytics.com) and take the "Harmonic syntax" quiz (session ID 140816).  

For class on **Wednesday, Nov. 20**, take your [keyboard performance exercises]({{ root_url }}/media/Unit3-keyboardStyle-chromatic.pdf), draw a circle or box around each instance of prolongation, and label it:

- Change-of-figure prolongation,  
- Change-of-bass prolongation,  
- Contrapuntal prolongation, or  
- Subsidiary harmonic progression.

Bring it to class for discussion. (Note that the chromatic chords on those exercises were not covered in the above reading. Don't let that confuse you, since you should be able to do the above assignment fine without thatâ€”and you may be able to guess what those symbols mean, anyway.)

Also bring staff paper for dictation/recognition work.
