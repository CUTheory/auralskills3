Listen to Radiohead's ["Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box"](http://open.spotify.com/track/1lv2cq78vX9q9Sz8uqkTSu) (Spotify URI: spotify:track:1lv2cq78vX9q9Sz8uqkTSu) while following along with the [timeline]({{ root_url }}/media/PacktTimeline.pdf) I created. Listen several times until you can identify each of the elements by ear while listening. If you have difficulty with a specific element or passage, post a question on Piazza.

Also, find a partner or partners for the transcription project and choose a song. If more than one group select the same song, we'll negotiate that on Monday. Come with a second choice, just in case.

Bring staff and notebook paper to class on Monday.
