For *Friday, Nov. 15, 8am*, update your self-evaluation including:

- Comments on your melodic and rhythmic dictation ability so far. Be sure to note what you are struggling with and your plans to improve on it by the end of the semester.  
- An update on *functional diatonicism* (in-key chords), *functional chromaticism* (applied and chromatically altered chords), and *performance* in light of your keyboard performance videos, including updated letter grades.  
- Anything missing from the last round of self-evaluations, which I noted in the comments section last week.

For *Monday, Nov. 18, 10am*, work with your group to complete a draft of your transcription project. Make sure there is an up-to-date PDF in your Google Drive project folder.
