Before class on Wed./Thurs., Dec. 4/5, read the following resources:

- [Chromatically altered subdominant chords](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/alteredSubdominants.html)  
- [Applied chords](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/appliedChords.html)  
- [Modal mixture](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/modalMixture.html)  

*Write down* any questions you have about any of these resources, and bring them to class. Bring staff paper to class, as well as a device that can display these resources while you are working on dictating/transcribing progressions making use of these harmonic structures.
