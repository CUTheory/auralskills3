For 8am on Friday, Sept. 27, make a video of your performance of the entire movement of "Der Neugierige" (movement VI of *Die schöne Müllerin*: [recording](https://play.spotify.com/user/kris.shaffer/playlist/1SaXv4tlZlW931nZ9a8q1o), [score](http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/03233)) upload to Google Drive, and share with your instructor.

If you have any questions about the modulations or syllables beyond what is discussed in class, use Piazza to consult with each other and/or your instructor.

For Meeting 10 (Mon./Tues., Sept. 30/Oct. 1), print out the score to "Der Müller und der Bach," listen to it (same playlist and score as above), and mark all cadences by key and cadence type.

Also, practice the harmonic sequentials and arpeggio exercises distributed in class.
