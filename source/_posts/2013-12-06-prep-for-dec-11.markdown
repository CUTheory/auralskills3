There is no homework for Wednesday's class. Simply work on whatever is giving you the most difficulty in advance of the exam. If you need resources to help you with that, please let me know, and I can provide some based on student requests.

Please sign up for a single 10-minute sight-singing exam slot on the [Google Calendar schedule](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY).
