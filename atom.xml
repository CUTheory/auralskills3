    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For <em>Friday, Nov. 15, 8am</em>, update your self-evaluation including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comments on your melodic and rhythmic dictation ability so far. Be sure to note what you are struggling with and your plans to improve on it by the end of the semester.</li>
<li>An update on <em>functional diatonicism</em> (in-key chords), <em>functional chromaticism</em> (applied and chromatically altered chords), and <em>performance</em> in light of your keyboard performance videos, including updated letter grades.</li>
<li>Anything missing from the last round of self-evaluations, which I noted in the comments section last week.</li>
</ul>


<p>For <em>Monday, Nov. 18, 10am</em>, work with your group to complete a draft of your transcription project. Make sure there is an up-to-date PDF in your Google Drive project folder.</p>

Choose any reasonable tempo that is comfortable. You may also sumbit audio recordings made in the keyboard lab that authenticate via your IdentiKey, if you already know how to do that.</p>

In lieu of a class meeting, get together with your transcription group during class time at a location of your choosing (a practice room, perhaps) and work on your transcription project. At the end of the 50 minutes, compose a short paragraph detailing the progress made on the project during that time, and make sure that your updated version is uploaded to Google Drive as a PDF. I prefer if you upload new PDF files each time you update your transcription (named version 1, version 2, etc.) so that I can track your progress.</p>

<p>By you Oct. 28/29 class meeting, work with your group to transcribe at least the first <em>cycle</em> of your song (first strophe in a strophic song, first verse–(prechorus)–chorus in a V-C song). Put your transcription in music notation software.</p>

<p>Make a folder in Google Drive with all group members&#8217; last names and &#8220;Unit 2 transcription&#8221; in the folder title. Share it with all group members and your instructor, with editing privileges. Make a PDF of your transcription, and upload it to that folder.</p>

<h2>Shaffer section:</h2>

<p>For Wednesday, Oct. 23, listen to <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/7IzLAli1EfsUYTLgfp4MvM">New Years Day</a> (spotify URI: spotify:track:7IzLAli1EfsUYTLgfp4MvM). Follow along with the keyboard part on the score in the MUSC 2121 shared materials folder in GDrive.</p>

<p>Also, find a partner or partners for the transcription project and choose a song. If more than one group select the same song, we&#8217;ll negotiate that on Monday. Come with a second choice, just in case.</p>

<p>Bring staff and notebook paper to class on Monday.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="http://cutheory.github.io/auralskills3/2013/10/meeting-11-and-12-assignment/">the assignment already posted</a> for Tuesday morning, also take the <a href="http://learningcatalytics.com">Learning Catalytics</a> quiz on the cadences in &#8220;Erlkönig&#8221; (session ID 731080) before Wednesday&#8217;s class. Some of these were already covered in class. You can find the video played in class <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3nxyS8wf8E">here</a>. Audio recordings abound.

<ul>
<li>Respond to at least six of your classmates&#8217; rhythm excerpts on Piazza, as before. Affirm or critique (gently and helpfully).</li>
<li>Make a video of yourself singing &#8220;Der Müller und der Bach&#8221; as accurately as possible, noting modulations in your syllables, and submit it to your instructor via Google Drive.</li>
</ul>


<p>This will take quite some time, so be sure not to wait until Monday/Tuesday evening to begin. And do use a recording, a keyboard, or a classmate as you learn &#8220;Der Müller und der Bach,&#8221; so that you can get those modulations and chromatic-chord arpeggios into your ear.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For Meeting 11 (Oct. 2/3), fill out your Unit II rhythmic portfolio on Piazza. For each of the six categories, make sure you have provided one correct example in Piazza. If excerpts you previously have submitted have been confirmed by your colleagues or instructor, don&#8217;t worry about that category. However, for categories you have not attempted yet, or for categories where your example was proven incorrect by your colleagues or instructor, provide a new example.</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you are clear on compound meter. 5/4, 7/4, etc. are <em>not</em> compound meter.</strong> Also, please help your classmates and instructor out by using Spotify, rather than YouTube, if possible. Those YouTube commercials are getting longer and popping up more frequently.</p>

<p>If, for whatever reason (I know a few of you were sick), you did not get the video of &#8220;Der Neugierige&#8221; in on Friday, get that in ASAP.</p>

<p>Also, begin practicing &#8220;Der Müller und der Bach.&#8221; A video attempt of that song will be due later this week.</p>

<p>Finally, note that we will be extending the singing part of Unit II beyond the initial target of Oct. 2/3. More details will come soon.</p>
