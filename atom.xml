    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>8am, Friday, Dec. 6,</strong> update your self-evaluation. On your self-assessment document, please re-write each section from scratch (copying and pasting is fine, though, if it fits the guidelines below). Don&#8217;t worry about losing any material. Everything you erase from a Google Doc is still accessible in the document history. Your new self-assessment should contain all of the same categories. For each category, write no more than a single paragraph that touches on all of the points listed below, and assign yourself a letter grade for every category except for dictation. Please follow the rubric below <em>precisely</em>.</p>

<p>For <strong>class on Monday, Dec. 9,</strong> practice your melodic sight-singing with the melodies distributed in class on Wednesday. The final dictation melodies will be drawn from the missing pages in those chapters. They will be easier excerpts of the same variety, so the more you practice with these, the better prepared you will be for the final. You may also find the <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/sightSinging.html">Sight-singing tips</a> on the resources site helpful as you prepare for the exam.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Tuesday, Nov. 19, 8am</strong>, please do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/harmonicFunctions.html">Harmonic functions</a> resource.</li>
<li>Read the <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/harmonicSyntax.html">Harmonic syntax</a> resource.</li>
<li>Log in to <a href="http://learningcatalytics.com">Learning Catalytics</a> and take the &#8220;Harmonic syntax&#8221; quiz (session ID 140816).</li>
</ul>


<p>For class on <strong>Wednesday, Nov. 20</strong>, take your <a href="http://CUTheory.github.com/auralskills3/media/Unit3-keyboardStyle-chromatic.pdf">keyboard performance exercises</a>, draw a circle or box around each instance of prolongation, and label it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change-of-figure prolongation,</li>
<li>Change-of-bass prolongation,</li>
<li>Contrapuntal prolongation, or</li>
<li>Subsidiary harmonic progression.</li>
</ul>


<p>Bring it to class for discussion. (Note that the chromatic chords on those exercises were not covered in the above reading. Don&#8217;t let that confuse you, since you should be able to do the above assignment fine without that—and you may be able to guess what those symbols mean, anyway.)</p>

<p>Also bring staff paper for dictation/recognition work.</p>

I prefer if you upload new PDF files each time you update your transcription (named version 1, version 2, etc.) so that I can track your progress.</p>

<p>By you Oct. 28/29 class meeting, work with your group to transcribe at least the first <em>cycle</em> of your song (first strophe in a strophic song, first verse–(prechorus)–chorus in a V-C song). Put your transcription in music notation software.</p>

<p>Make a folder in Google Drive with all group members&#8217; last names and &#8220;Unit 2 transcription&#8221; in the folder title. Share it with all group members and your instructor, with editing privileges. Make a PDF of your transcription, and upload it to that folder.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="http://cutheory.github.io/auralskills3/2013/10/meeting-11-and-12-assignment/">the assignment already posted</a> for Tuesday morning, also take the <a href="http://learningcatalytics.com">Learning Catalytics</a> quiz on the cadences in &#8220;Erlkönig&#8221; (session ID 731080) before Wednesday&#8217;s class. Some of these were already covered in class. You can find the video played in class <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3nxyS8wf8E">here</a>. Audio recordings abound. The score passed out in class can be downloaded <a href="http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/IMSLP15041-SchubertD328_Erlk__nig_4th_version.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For <em>the day after meeting 12 (Tues./Wed., Oct. 8/9)</em>, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Respond to at least six of your classmates&#8217; rhythm excerpts on Piazza, as before. Affirm or critique (gently and helpfully).</li>
<li>Make a video of yourself singing &#8220;Der Müller und der Bach&#8221; as accurately as possible, noting modulations in your syllables, and submit it to your instructor via Google Drive.</li>
</ul>


<p>This will take quite some time, so be sure not to wait until Monday/Tuesday evening to begin. And do use a recording, a keyboard, or a classmate as you learn &#8220;Der Müller und der Bach,&#8221; so that you can get those modulations and chromatic-chord arpeggios into your ear.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For Meeting 11 (Oct. 2/3), fill out your Unit II rhythmic portfolio on Piazza. For each of the six categories, make sure you have provided one correct example in Piazza. If excerpts you previously have submitted have been confirmed by your colleagues or instructor, don&#8217;t worry about that category. However, for categories you have not attempted yet, or for categories where your example was proven incorrect by your colleagues or instructor, provide a new example.</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you are clear on compound meter. 5/4, 7/4, etc. are <em>not</em> compound meter.</strong> Also, please help your classmates and instructor out by using Spotify, rather than YouTube, if possible. Those YouTube commercials are getting longer and popping up more frequently.</p>

<p>If, for whatever reason (I know a few of you were sick), you did not get the video of &#8220;Der Neugierige&#8221; in on Friday, get that in ASAP.</p>

<p>Also, begin practicing &#8220;Der Müller und der Bach.&#8221; A video attempt of that song will be due later this week.</p>

<p>Finally, note that we will be extending the singing part of Unit II beyond the initial target of Oct. 2/3. More details will come soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For 8am on Friday, Sept. 27, make a video of your performance of the entire movement of &#8220;Der Neugierige&#8221; (movement VI of <em>Die schöne Müllerin</em>: <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/kris.shaffer/playlist/1SaXv4tlZlW931nZ9a8q1o">recording</a>, <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/03233">score</a>) upload to Google Drive, and share with your instructor.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the modulations or syllables beyond what is discussed in class, use Piazza to consult with each other and/or your instructor.</p>

<p>For Meeting 10 (Mon./Tues., Sept. 30/Oct. 1), print out the score to &#8220;Der Müller und der Bach,&#8221; listen to it (same playlist and score as above), and mark all cadences by key and cadence type.</p>

<p>Also, practice the harmonic sequentials and arpeggio exercises distributed in class.</p>
